# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Rename the user-facing music button label to exactly “For You” across the music player UI.

**Planned changes:**
- Update the music player UI text so any displayed music button label reads exactly “For You” (including collapsed/floating states and any related toggle/button text).
- Verify no other UI copy changes and that music player behavior remains unchanged (play/pause, volume, mute, audio source).

**User-visible outcome:** Anywhere the music button text appears, it now displays “For You” while the music player continues to work as before.
