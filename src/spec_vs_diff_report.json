  "summary": "REQ-19 is not verifiably implemented in the provided diff summary. The only concrete change related to audio playback is adding a frontend/.env value; there is no shown code change to frontend/src/components/MusicPlayer.tsx to actually read VITE_HUM_TERE_PYAAR_MEIN_AUDIO_SRC, play/loop via HTMLAudioElement, and fall back safely when missing/unplayable.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-19",
      "requirement": "Configure the MusicPlayer to play the user-uploaded audio file for “Hum Tere Pyaar Mein — Lata Mangeshkar” by using import.meta.env.VITE_HUM_TERE_PYAAR_MEIN_AUDIO_SRC as the runtime audio source so Play triggers real HTMLAudioElement playback (looping), with safe fallback to the existing generated-tone behavior when missing/empty/unplayable, and without attempting Spotify link playback.",
      "reason": "The diff summary does not include any modification to the actual MusicPlayer implementation file, so there is no evidence that HTMLAudioElement playback/looping, environment-variable wiring, unplayable-source fallback handling, or Spotify-link avoidance logic was implemented in code. Adding a .env value alone does not implement runtime playback behavior.",

        "ADDED: frontend/.env",
        "MODIFIED: frontend-file-summaries.txt (descriptive only; not the actual component code)",
