The diff shows MusicPlayer logic changes and a file summary claiming “For You” is shown only in a specific collapsed/not-playing state; the actual UI label occurrences are not visible in the truncated diff, and additional playback behavior (Web Audio API fallback tone) appears to have been added beyond the request.",

      "requirement": "Update the music player UI so the user-facing label for the music button is renamed to exactly “For You” anywhere the music button text is displayed (e.g., collapsed/floating button label and any related toggle/button text).",
      "reason": "The provided diff content for MusicPlayer.tsx is truncated before any rendered button/label text, so it does not demonstrate that *all* user-facing occurrences were renamed. The only explicit mention in the diff summary indicates “For You” is shown conditionally (\"when collapsed and not playing\"), which may not satisfy the requirement to apply anywhere the music button text is displayed.",
